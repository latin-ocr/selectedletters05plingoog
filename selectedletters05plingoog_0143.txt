Prope publici operis. It almost rivalled the splendid works ol this
kind which then existed in the Forum and Campus. The ‘cryptoporticus’ of
this villa seerns to have run out from it at right angles on its north or north·
western side, and to have been carried on parallel with the coast. which may
be supposed to have run from N.W. to sE. The Xystus lay between it
and thesea, and on the inland side was the garden. It could not well have
been on the south-eastern side, as we are told above thar that was appropri-
ated to the slaves.

74. Alternis, ‘alternately’ The meaning seems to be that the windows
towards the sea were in groups of two or three (‘ plures ’); that the oppo-
site wall had but single windows corresponding to these groups‚ and even
these single windows were not opposite to each group, but only to every
other group.

77. xystus, a terrase with flowerbeds and omamental shrubs. Vitruvius
notices the different senses of the word in Greek and Latin respectively,
(Ξυστός enirn Graeca appellatione est porticus ampla latitudine in qua
athletae per hiberna tempora exercentur. Nostri autem hypaethras ambu-
lationes xystos appellant' Vitr. 6. 10. The name is derived from the
smooth floor, ebor. .

89. ln eapite xysti deinceps cryptoporticum ‘at the head of the
terrace and then at the head oi the covered walt! ‘Cryptoporticus’ is a
gen. govemed by ‘in capite.¹ The terrace and portico were parallel and
conterminous‚ both being closed hythe wall of the garden-house (horti
diaeta), which cut straight across them. ‘Deinceps ' in this passage means
little more than ‘deiude' and has not its usual sense of ‘ one after another.'

91. Heuoaaminuc a room exposed on every side to the sun, aud
therefore suitable for winter use without artificial warmth.

93. zotheca. This name was originally applied to cages or closets for
keeping sarred poultry. Hence it was transferred to small rooms ior purposes
of study or retirement. ' ’

96. Atergovillne5 those of which he speaks below, ‘nunccontinua Δ ¹

nunc intermissa tecta vittarum!

102. Andron, an alley or passage running between the wall of the bed·
chamber arrd that of the garden. An ‘andron ' in the Greek sense would, of
course, have been l'ar from contributing to the quiet os the room. This
word, like ‘xystus' above, is noticed byVitr.6. 10, as having acquired a
different sense in the phraseoIogy of Roman architecture.

109. Abesse. This snite¹ ol rooms was removed from the villa by the
whole length of the ‘cryptoporticus'

112. Haeo utilitas, sc. ‘villae’ Ι

114. Sunt enim in summo, ‘for they are surlace springs! 'Putei' were
wells in which the water lay deep: but the shallow wells here described were
properly called ‘ sontes! The substantive ‘summurn’ is frequently used t'or

the surface of water, and here for the surface of the ground in which the
water appears.
