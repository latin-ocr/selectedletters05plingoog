Ep. 42. 1. In eonsilium adsumptus. The emperors had a limired
number oi advisers, whom they summoned for consultation. just as inferior
officers, eg. praetors and proconsuls summoned their 'consiliarii’ The
famous ‘Council oi the Turbot' (Juv. 4. 75 sqq.), whether real or fictitious,
testifies to the existence of this custom, which is said to have been instituted
by Augustus. Pliny was often summoned (‘frequenter in consilio fui’ Ep. 13.
51), as for instance in the trial of Atticinus, Bk. 6. aa, and that of Ariston,
with others, Bk. 6. 31. See Merivale, Hist. Emp. c. 67.

in order as they sat.

9. Iunius Mauricus. See note on Ep. 28. to sub fin.

11. Etiam Romae. These performances had been fostered to encess by
Domitian. See Merivale, Hist. Emp. c. 62.

Pliny’s assent to the sternness ol Mauricus is somewhat inconsistent with

what he says to Maximus, Ep. 63, although it be in accordance with his
