PREFACE.

Trrn text ol this selection of Pliny’s letters is that of Keil
(Leipsig, 1870). Keil has prefixed to this (his second
edition) an admirable account of the materials extant for
a critical edition of the works of the author, and an
estimate of their comparative authority. He distinguishes ·
three families of extant MSS. The first is represented by ’
the Medicean and Vatican MSS. Of these the Vatican,
though perhaps the more ancient, contains only the first
four books. The Medicean, containing all the letters
except those to and from Trajan, must therefore hold the
first place in importance.

The second family is best represented by the Florentine
MS, and contains only one hundred letters.

The third family is of a much later date, and consists
of a great number of MSS. of the fifteenth century, which
are also all imperfect, as they omit the eighth book, and
put either the fifth or the ninth in its place. Keil considers
the Codex Dresdensis the most valuable of this class of
uss '

The letters to and from Trajan (formerly called the tenth
book), stand on a different footing. We have no MS.
authority for their text, and depend entirely on printed
