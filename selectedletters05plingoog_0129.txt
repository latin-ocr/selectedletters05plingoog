NOTES.

“Convictus, thermae, stationes, omne theatrum
De Rutilo’ Juv. 11. 4. ’

13. Nonianum. M. Servilius Nonianus wascelebrated both as an historian
andan orator. When relating his death (nn. 60), Tacitus speaks of him
as ‘diu foro, mox tradendis rebus Romanis celebris et elegantia vitae' Ann.
1419· Qriutiliam who had heard him, considered him a man of marked
genius; but his style, though rich, was somewhat too diffisso for history: ‘Clari
vir ingenii, et sententiis creber, sed minus pressus quam historiae auctoritas
postulat’ 10. t. hle was consul ab. 35, under Tiberius.

16. Quis non perdiderit. The subi. does not necessarily follow
‘quia’ lt expresses not the actual or objective cause of the complaiut, but
the idea· which was the ground of it, aud is used here with a delicate irony:
‘they complain that they have lost a day ou the ground that-they have
not lost it.’

ao. Ut non simul et nos emet. ‘Ut non’ is used thus after negative
propositione to denote an inevitable consequence. ‘There is no one who
loves literature, but be must also lore me! ‘Ruere illa non possunt, ut
haec non eodem labefacta metu concidaut' cic. pro L. Man. 7. Madvig,
5440· 3« ¹

²4· Nou auditor . . . . creditor, ‘to have been there not to listeu but
to put them under an obligation' Pliny shows more delicacy than Juvenal,
who wants an equivalent for his attendance ε ‘Nunquamne reponam' Juv. 1. r.

ΕΡ. 9. Junius Mauricus, to whom this letter is addressed, was (like his
brother Arulenus Rusticus)a man of courage and independeuce of character.
He was one of the set of good men bauished by Domitian at the close of his
reign, when his brother Rusticus was put to death. Even towards Vespasian
he had shown his bolduess, in requesting that the emperor’s journals might
be iuspected iu order to bring the informers to justice. He returned from
banishment iu the reign of Nerva, and used similar freedom towards him.
‘Quo viro nihil firmius, nihil verius’ is Pliny’s description of him (Ep. 42. 9).
This letter aud another (Ep. aa), answering an enquiry made by Mauricus
fora tutor for his brother's orphan children, show the care with witich
he attended to their interests.

8. meno Rustico. Rusticus is mentioned by Tacitus in lais account
of the murder of Thrasea by Nero, as theu au ardent young man who would
bave interposed his veto, as tribune, ou the decree of the senate condemuing
Thrasea, unless the latter had forbidden bini, as it would ouly have led to
his own destruction. Iu the civil wars that followed Nero’s death, Rusticus
was praetor when Vespasian's forces advauced on Rome, and being sent by
Vitellius to offer them conditione of peace, was wounded and nearly killed.
With others of the best meu in Rome he was put to death by Domitian, for
writing in praise of Thrmea. For a general view of the sufferings of Pliny's
friends see on Ep. 28.

rs. A vobis, the brothers above mentioued, Junius Mauricus and Arulenus
Rusticus.
