formula of appeal to the citizens, ‘Porro Qrirites,' used by those in danger
of injustice or illtreatment. Varr. de Ling. Lat. 5. 7. So in a fragment of
Laberius, preserved in Macrob. Sat. a. 7, we find the words ‘Porro Quirites,
libertatem perdimus,' put into the mouth ofa man who is being scourged.

63. Illud . . . illud, this part and that part of the town.

71. Misero, to be construed with solacio.

74. Deficit, the proper word for eclipse. Cp. ‘Solis defectiones itemque
lunae praedicuntur in multos annos’ Cic. de Div. a. 6. ·

77. Utcumque: see note on Ep. 46. 7.

Ep. 62. 1. Tollite cuncta, the address of Vulcan to his Cyclopes, Virg.

ι Aen. 8. 439.

 

3. Illa mma, the arms to be made for Aeneas. The comparison is not
exact, as Vulean did not bring the arms, but the order· sor thern.

8. Intra undecim dies, quam. This involved idiom requires to be
traced carefully. The simplest construction would have been ‘undecim
diebus postquam.' But sometimes ‘post' is transferred to the beginning of
the sentence, and the phrase left to stand thus, ‘post undecim dies quam’
Madvig, § 270, Obs. 4, note, cp. § 276, Obs. 6. But in the present instance
‘post’ would not exactly express the meaning of the writer, and ‘intra' is
substituted for it. Thus ‘post' disappears from the sentence, but ‘quam,'
which belonged to it syntectically‚ is nevertheless retained, and forced ‘into
conjunction with ‘intra’ Cp. ‘intra quintum quarn affuerat diern’ Suet. Jui.
35. Such instances of the construction proper to one particle being applied
to another, are characteristic os a decaying ianguage.

9. Quadruplici iudicio: see note on Ep. 12. 9.

ra. Advocatio, sc. ‘advocati’ Cp. ‘cum ingenti advocatione' Liv.
s· 47·

Subsellia, occupied by the audience. The same terme are employed
in the description of the court, Ep. 20. a 5.

14. Tribunel, the raised dais at the further end of the basilica, on which
the judges sat. It was sometimes thrown back in the form of an apse, and
on the conversion of basilicas into churehes became the sauctuary where the
altar was placed.

Ex superiore basilicae porte, the galleries, which are somewhat ob-
seurely described by Vitruvius 5. 1. It was difficult for persons in thern to hear
the proceedings, but easy to look down and see them. They were reached
by a staircase from the outside of the building. They were defended by a
low balustrade from the hali within, and were probabiy' open to the air, being
little more than the roofs of the side aisles.

18. Duobus consiliis, by the verdier of two out of the four ‘consilia'
into which the 180 judges were divided. It appears at first sight that the
verdict of two out of the four carried the day in Pliny’s favour. But as two
points on which he was successful are mentioned below, victo noverca . . .
victua Suborinus, it may be that each of the four ‘consilia' though
sitting together, gave its verdict on a different issue in the case, and that
