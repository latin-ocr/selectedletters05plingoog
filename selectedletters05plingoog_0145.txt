Remulus, M. Aquilius, the ioremost of that crowd oi 'delatores'
which gathered round the bad emperors. He was a creature oi Domitian,
and is accordingly flattered by Martial in four epigrams, which chiefly relate
tobis escape from the fall of a portico. Pliny in sketching this man's char·
acter unconsciously gives us a foil to his own. He was utterly wanting in

'Pliny's high qualities of honour, liberality, humanity, and truthfulness.
Bk. 1. 5 gives au amusing account of his apprehensiou aiter the loss oi bis
patron Domitian. For the rise and influence ol the delatores, see an admirable
sketch in Merivale, llist. Emp. c. 44,

5. Inpudentiem: cp. ‘hominem te patientem’ Ep. 18. 1.

10. Olimwterioum. All multiples of 7 and 9 were called climacteric
years, and thought dangerous to life. 7x9=63 was therefore the grand
climacteric, cp. Geli. 3. 10. Regulus employed the term in his jargon to
frighten Aurelia.

a9. Scholastica lege. k common and erroneous interpretation is ‘like
an idle fellow‚’ which gives ‘tertiam’ no more sense than ‘aliam’ This is
much too pointless for our author's style. There must be an allusion to some
unknown precept oi the schools, perhaps one requiring that a thesis should
be illustrated by at least three instantem cp. Ep. 31· which is iu fact a theme ,
on the subject ⁶ alia clariora, alia maiora,' illustrated by ebrae incidente from
the lile ol Arria the elder. ’

30. Ornata, adjectival, not participial, in sense3 ‘a lady of rank! ·

Aurelia: we leam from another source also that she was an obiect
of attention to ‘captatores’ Juvs 5. 98.

4a. consuleret quam cito, ¹ was inquiring how soon!

45. Aliena testamenta, ‘other people’s wille!

Inprobissimum genus falsi, ‘a most impudent kind of trickery.'
‘Falsum’ was a wider word than ‘forgery,’ embracing also base coinage, and,
as we learn from this passage, undue influence.

46. Ipsis quorum aunt ille. This is put thus emphatically to mark how
Regulus reversed the naturai order of things. Usually the testator dictated
to some one else the terms of his will: but here we find Regulus dictating
them to the testator. ‘Dicto' is the technical word for such transactione.
Cp. ‘rivalis dictabitur heres' Juv. 6. 218.

up. 24. 8. Sera, ‘too late.'

11. Leotu103 not in bed, but on his writing couch. They used for the
purposes oi study, not chairs and desks, but a south, ‘lectus' ‘lectulus’
‘lecticula’ Cp. ‘lacere in lectulo suo compositus in habitunt studentis‘

whole loot, while the ‘soleae’ worn at other times, were merely sandals.

25. Lysias. Four mutilated lyrical fragments bearing the title ‘Ves-
tricius Spurinna De contemptu Saeculi ¹ were discovered aud edited by Barthius
in 1613. They are probably early lotgeriea suggested by this passage, and
