160 norae.

30. Novissime, ‘the last of the race ;' the last, that is to say, endued
with the virtues of the race. Cp. ¹0. Cassium Romanorum ultimum' Tac.
Ann.4. 34.

38. Ultor reversatum. See Ep. 77. 24.

Non feci temen paria. Cp. 'parem calculum ponere’ Ep. 45. 1.

nn. 68. 5. Curtio Rufo. This story is confirmed by Tac. Arm. 11.
tr. Curtius owed his promotion to Tiberius, so the tale was an old one.

6. obtinenti Africam, the magistrate in charge of the province.

²7· Longior=⁴diuturnior5 lasting longer than the sights and sounds
which caused it.

28. Monstro. ‘Mostellum’ the diminutive of ‘monstrum' also means

¹ a ‘ghost,' and hence the name of Plautns's comedy, ‘Mostellaria'

Proscribebntur: see on Ep. 64. a.

Α 30. Athenodorus, said to have been tutor to Augustus. This therefore
is another old story, and Lucian also gives a version oi it with different
names.

39. Aua-ibaeque praetendere, sc. ‘animum ς’ i.e. ‘animo aures custo·
dire ne vana audiant! His hands were engaged in writing, so we can neither
take ‘praetendere’ absolutely 'nor supply ‘manum' ‘Praetendere animum
auribus’ is a bold and poetical expression; but not more so than our own
phrase ‘to shut one’s ear to a story,' which, like the Latin, represents as a
physical act that which is really no more than a determination of the mind.

43. Ut paulum expectaret manu significat. ‘The historical
present is conceived and treated with reference to the propositione depending
upon it, sometimes as an actual present, sometimes (according to the
signification) as a perfect.' Madvig, ξ 382, Obs. 3. Cp. above dimittit
. . ,intendit . . . ne fingeret. The sequence of tenses would of course
require ‘fingat’ ‘expectet’ after present tenses which were not historical. ’

61. In paedagogio. ‘Paedagogium' was the name, not of a part of the
house, but of the company of young slaves among whom this slave was
sleeping. At any rate this is the sense of the word in all the other passages
where it occurs.

67. A Caro, one of Domitian’s informers, mentioned in the preceding
letter. He knew he had made Pliny his enemy by his share in the death of
Pliny’s friend Senecio, and in the exile of Fannia widow of Helvidius. He
would therefore naturally endeavour to put him ont of the way.

69. Moris est submittere capillum. For this custom cp.

‘Cuius manantia fletu
Ora puellares faciunt incerta capilli’ Juv.15. 136.

74. Ex eltera3 to fill up the sense supply ‘disputa' from disputes
above. ‘Altera' here stands for ‘altemtra’ ‘one or the other,¹ as in Cic.
Att.11.18 ‘Qrorum fortasse utmmque erit; alterum certe! Pliny begs
his correspondent to convince him one way or the other.

Servavit ; Fannia contrived to preserve one copy.
¹ 25. Viri, ‘we men.’ '
