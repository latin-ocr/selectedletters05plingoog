LETTERS OF Ο. PLINIUS C. SECUNDUS. 133

so eomposed as to accord with what is here said of Spurinna. See
Wernsdorf's Poet. Lat. Min, vol. 3.

26. Gratiam cumulat. This makes it probable that Spurinna's verses
were somewhat free iu their tone. Elsewhere (Blr. 4. 14) we find that Pliny
considered such freedom not only consistent with purity of life, but also, as
it were, an agreeable relief.

a7 Nuntiate est; a slave watched the 'solarium’ or the ¹clepsydra,'
and announceu the expiration of each bour.

29. Moretur pilu3 aa was usual before bathing. Old men commonly
played with the ‘follis' a larger aud lighter hall, requiring less exertion than
the‘pila.'

34 Puro, ‘plain' without ornament. Spurinna's simple and refined
taste preferred this to the more admired ‘caelatum’ or ‘asperum argentum.¹
See Becker’s Gallus, Sc. a. n. τι.

35. Corinthla; vessels made of the rare and costly Corinthiau bronze.
Even Pliny had nothing in his villa of this material, and when he bought a
‘Corinthium signum,' placed it in a temple as ‘dignum deo donum' Ep. ²6. 17.
The secret of manufacturIng Corinthia had long been lost, hence their value.

Adfloituu a word of strong emotion, here contrasted with the
modnote pleasure signified by ‘delectatun’ cp. ‘delectare oculos im-
petitorum’ Ep. 26. 12.

36. comoedis. We have frequent mention in these letters oi entertain-
ments performed during dinner. At some houses ballet dancers (‘Gaditanae ’)
were introduced, Ep. 10. 8 ; or elowns (‘ scurrae vel moriones ⁹) strayed about
the room, Bk. 9. 17. But persons of a higher taste, such as Pliny and his
friends, diverted themselves with more instructive amusements, 'ut voluptates
quoque studiis condiantur! They resorted to standard authors, from which
history was read by the ‘lector,' poetry sung to music by the ‘lyristes' or

some passage of comedy rendered memoriter by the ‘comoedus’ Chosen -

slaves were trained for these several duties. Cp. for ‘lecton' cic. Pam. 5. 9 ;
for ‘comoedus’ Ep. 50. 8.

Ep. 25. 3. Indicis partibus. The words ‘titulus’ and ‘indere' with
reference to books, hare two distinct senses. lt cannot be said that the one
sense is always represented by ‘titulus’ and the other by ‘indere’ but at
. least the meanings themselves are clearly separate, by whiehever name either
may be designated. There was first the title written on the strip of paper
or parchment, and affired to the outside of the roll, aud this was usually
called ‘ titulus ;' secondly, there was the table of eontents, found in some
books, written inside the book, probably at the beginning, and this is the
usual sense of ‘ index‚’ or ‘iudices' Such were the indices composed by
Pliny the elder for his Natural History‚ and by Gellius for his Noctes Atticae.
lt is easy to see that from such an index of the contents oi one book might
grow arr index deseribing, as iu this letter, all the works of one author, or
even an index of the works of various authors of the same class, such as
that alluded to by Seneca, 'sume in manus indicem philosophorum' Seu. Ep.
