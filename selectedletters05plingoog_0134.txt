LETTERS OF Ο. PLINIUS Ο. SECUNDUS. 121 ι

lrinds of cases tried before the ‘centumviri’ They didered from the other
judges in being a definite body or ‘collegium’ and are said to have derived
their name from being chosen three from each of the thirty-five tribes,
making 105 originally. Augustus however enlarged the court, and it con·
tained 180 judges. Very young men appear to have practised in it, and Pliny
complains of the way in which the pleadings were conducted. He however
continued to plead in it occasionally iu the time of Trajan, or perhaps later,
and was pleaaed with the crowded audiences which listened to him. Ep. ao

Ep. 13. 4. Praevaricetio. Observe that ‘praevaricatio' is the predicate.
The word means the betrayal of his cause by an advocate, and was used most
properly of the accuser, but also of the defendant. Pliny frequently uses it
in its proper sense, as in Bk. 3. 9 ‘Accidit enim res contraria et nova,'ut
accusatore praevaricationis mutuato rea absolveretur? Cicero (Fam. 8. 11)
uses ‘praevaricator publicae causae’ for one who culpably neglects public
interests. lt is derived from ‘varus' and a ploughman who makes a croolred
furrow is said ‘praevaricari' by Pliny the elder, who adds ‘inde translatum
hoc crimen in fomm’ H. N. 18. 49. Cp. expression borrowed from turf

ro. Lysiae. Lysias is likened to Cato by Cicero (Brut. 16), who says of
both, ‘Acuti sunt, elegantes, faceti, breves.’ He wrote a great number oi
orations for others to use, of which two only are said to have been unsuc·
cessful. He was born at Athens uc. 458. Thirty-five of his orations are
extant, besides fragments of others. Of those of Cato, which were almost
equally numerous, only fragments remain. Cicero, who had read more than
150 of them, praises them highly, especially for vigour aud weight, but says
that even in his time few persons read, or even knew them at all, and admits
a certain ronghuess of style in them. Brut. 17. Smith’s Dict. Biog.
