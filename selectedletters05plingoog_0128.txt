LETTERS OF 0. PLINIUS U. SECUNDUS. 115

he thinks. a mere fashion, the result of ¹satiety and weariness, or, at best, of
false reasoning, not of political indignation aud hopelessness. See Merivale's

Hssldtpldtdddfddessnum proventum poetarum, ‘a great erop,’ or ,⁸

‘abundance of poets.' The original use of the word is of the growth
of corn, fruits, or increase of animaist
'Proventuque oneret sulcos, atque horrea vincat’
Virg. Georg. 2. 518.

The number of persons who employed or amused themselves with literature Ι

at Rome, in the time of Pliny, is very remarkable. The Roman nobles
were highly educated, and the jealousy of the Emperors, depriving the
aristocracy of active interest in public affairs, turned their thoughts the
more towards literary exertion. Almost every distinguished man among
them wrote either prose or verse; and as the remembrance of freedom
became faiuter, the style of these compositions improved iu a certain arti·
ficial polish and exactness, while they became ‘less vigorous and daring in
thought. Mr. Merivale contrasts in this respect the writings of the Fla-
vian age (nn. 70-96) with those of the previous generatious; Hist. Emp.
c. 54 and c. 64.

2. Quo non recitaret aliquis. The subj. is the proper mood of
dependent relative clauses, (1) when a quality is to be expressed, belonging
to the subject of the principal sentence, as ‘non is es qui gloriere;' (a)
when it is stated that there is, or is not, something of which the relative
clause may be asserted, as ‘nemo est orator qui se Demosthenis similem
esse nolit’ Cic. de Opt. Gen. Or. a. Madvig, §§ 3⁶4 365.

lt was the custom of poets and historiens at Rome to read their works
aloud to a select circle of friends in their own houses, or to larger audiences ·
in public rooms hired for the purpose. Pliny makes frequent allusions to
these recitations, and considered it a duty of friendship to attend them. It
was not so usual to recite orations, and he excuses himself on one occasion
for thus reading a speech which he had previously delivered, in order to
profit by the remarks of the hearers before publishing it. Bks.7.17and
8. 12. Juvenal speaks bitterly of the tediousness of some of the poets (1.
1-13); aud elsewhere of the interest felt when eminent authors, like
Statius, recited:

‘Curritur ad vocem iucundam et carmen amicae
Thebaidos, laetam fecit quum Statius urbem'
Juv. 7. 82.

3. Proforunt se, ‘bring themselves forward.’ Used by' Seneca of self·
taught men, ‘quibus ex se ipsis impetus fuit, qui seipsos protulerunt’ Ep.
52. Also by Pliny, ‘materiam se proferendi' Ep. 77. 7, ‘au opportunity for
bringing himself into notice! And by Tacitus, ‘Montanum quia protulerit
ingenium extorrem agi' Anu. 16. 29.

Stationibus, places of public resort, for ''conversation or amusement
‘Douros stationesque circumeo’ Bk. 2. 9.
