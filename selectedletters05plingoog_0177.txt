stantia' Sen. Qtaest. Nat. 4. 2. Verbs compounded with ‘ex’ which signify
motion, generally take the accusative, rarely the ablative, unless the pre·
position is repeated before the substantive.

¹ 7. stipes, 'small coins.' Seneca, in the passage quoted above, speaks of

Ι ‘stipes' thrown into the stream by the priests.

8. Devexitute. Substantives ending in ‘tas' are properly formed from
adjectives only, Madvig, ξ 184, 1. But ‘devexus’ being adjectival in sense
enjoys the privileges of ani‘adJective. So also we have from ‘falsus’
‘falsitas’ which has better authority than ‘devexitas' It was by the
multiplicatiori ot these convenient derivativas that the vocabulary was
increased, while the language was enervated.

9. Fons adhuc et iam amplissimum flumem avivid way of
describing the quick transition irorn a mere spring to a river, which transition
was the real marvel of the place; cpJSubita et ex abdito vasti amnis eruptio
aras habet' Sen. Ep. 41. ‘Est’ followed by a comma, suggests itself asan
easy emendation for ‘et,' and would simplify the sentence.

ra. Illa qua properat ipse, ‘down stream!

13. Remis.non adiuvetur. The currentis so swift that oars are not
required, and indeed cannot be used with advantage. Both ‘adiuvetur’ and

superetur hove the same nominative, namely Clitumnus, the river itself, ,
which is now irs the writer's thoughts though not expressed. Henoe l
raudus and advorsus come to be maso, and not nent, in concord with ¹

¹ flumen!
15. Ut flexerint cursum, via. either up stream or down stream.

18. lAdnumerut, ‘counts among its own charms,’ though ol course they .

properly belonged to the dry land.

aa. Sortes. Lots were also in use at Praeneste and Caere. At the
former place they consisted of sticks oi oak with characters graven on them,
Cic. de Div. a. 41.

26. Quod ponte transmittitur, ‘which is crossed (by the visitor) by
means of a bridge! ‘Transmittere flumen' means to cross a river, sor
although ‘mittere’ has dropped its original meaning and becomes intransitive,
=⁴mitti,’ yet the addition of ‘trans' enables it to govem an accusative.
See Madvig, § 224. Since then ‘transmittit flumen* may mean ‘he crosses
a river,' ‘transmittitur flumen' may mean ‘a river is crossed (by him).’
Finally, the ablative ‘ponte’ is thrown in to describe the means ol crossing;
cp. ‘ln transgressu Euphratis quem ponte transmittebat’ Tac. Anu. 15. 7.
Or it may be translated simply, ‘which is spanned bya bridge.’ This would
be a corruption oi the proper nse of ‘transmitto,’ paralleled by the am·
biguous English idiom ‘to be crossed bya bridge.'

27. Infra etium notare eoncessum. The sanitary object of keeping
clean springs meant sor use was attained under the religious pretext of their

sanctity. This was thoroughly in the spirit os the Roman cultas interpreted ,

by Mommsen (vol. i. p. 184). Cp. the ollence given by Nero's violatiou
of the much-prizcd ‘Aqua Marcia' Tac. Ann. 14. ¹22,
