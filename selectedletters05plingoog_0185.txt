Ροοί dum requiro. ‘Dum' used of a contemporary action usually
talges the present, although the action may be pasl, and the perfect be used
in the leading proposition. Cp. ‘Dum obsequor adolescentibus me senem
esse oblitus sum’ Cic. de Or. a. 4. ’ ,

ne. 90. This and the following letter attracted the notice of Christian
authors at an early period, and is ailuded to by Tertullian, Eusebius aud
Jerome.

‘Nowhere perhaps had Christianity adrauced with greater rapidity than
in the northern provinces of Asia Minor, where the inhabitants were of very
mingled descent, neither purely Greek nor essentially Asiatic, with a
considerable proportion of Jewish colonists chiefly of Babyloniae or Syriae,
not of Palestinian origin. It is here, in the province of bithynia, that
Polytheism firstdiscovered the deadly enemy which was undermining her
authority’ Milman's Hist. Chr. a. 6.

Alrhough Paul did not visit Bithynia (Acts 16. 7), yet the province might
easily have been evangelized from the neighbouring church of Galatia.

3. cognitionibus. lt is manifest, both from this expression and from
the executions ordered by Pliny aud sanctioned by the emperor, that
Christianity was already an offence amenable to capital punishmeuts and
this either under some eristing statute, or under the law of tbe empire, which
invested both the emperor aud the provincial governor with the arbitrary
power of life and death. See Milmau, l. c.

8. Nomen ipsum. lt is evident from Trajan’s auswer to this euquiry
(Ep. 91) that the mere profession and not the practice of Christianity, was
the object of punishment. This is a frequent matter of complaint with the
Christian apologists. Cp. ‘And ye shall be hated of all meu for my neme’s
sake' Matr. 10. aa.

12. Iberum uo tertio. In this repeated questioning may be seen the
rudiments of the system of torture afterwards employed to elicit a deuial of
the faith. Roman law did not accept a single confession of a prisoner as
proof of gnilt, unless the confession was supported by ertemal proof, but
required the confession to be repeated. Thus a provision of mescy became
a pretext for cruelty.

13. nuel, sc. ‘ad suppliciuni,’ a common euphemism.

14. Innexibilem obstinationem. constancy naturally appears
obstinacy to spectatore who do not see its relation to the object or person
external to itself whereon it depends. Pliny most probably, like his uncle
(Pliny N. H. 7. 56), could not conceive a future existence possible, and was
thus incapacitated for distinguishing between obstinacy and the constancy
of Christian hope. So also Marcus Aurelius (11. 5) says the Christiane
