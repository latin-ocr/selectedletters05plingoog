cuins tn mentio. The meaning is, ‘you who could bear ιο survive
your husband’s death.’ The disjointed mode of expression, et virts, is
a witness to the genuineness of the words.

38. Filiam tuam mori mecum. Twenty·four years later, as Thrasea
foresaw, a decision had to be made on this point, which resulted iu his
persuading Arria the younger to survive him for the sake uf their daughter
Fannia; Tac. Ann. 16. 34.

45. tmpegit Pliny's admiration for this ferociens attempt forms a
pendant ιο Seneca's observatiou, Ep. 70, in which, among anecdotes of hideour
suicides, he remarks, ‘cui difficilis occasio (mortis) est, is proximam quamque
pro optima arripiat, sit licet inaudita, sit nova!
