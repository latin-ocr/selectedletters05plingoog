LETTERS OF C. PLINIUS C. SECUNDUS. 159

to rear thern in hope 01 receiving assistance. It was not merely a provision
101 orphans, though they may have been included in its benefits. See
Merivala Hist. Emp. c. 63.

8. Longe pluris, worth a great deal more than five hundred thousand
sestertii.

Actori publi003 the clerk who received and disbursed the revenues
01 a city, just as the ‘actores privati' did in the case 01 private estates. Cp.

1100010001, ‘l conveyed’ lt was not a real sale, as Pliny only handed
it over in order to receive it back.

9. Tricrene milia. lle thus established a perpetual rent-charge on this
portion 01 his estate amounting to thirty thousand sestertii. This made
exactly the same provision 101 the charity at Cornum as a direct gift 01 a
capital (‘sors') of five hundred thousand sestertii would have done. For
the interest 01 that sum at the usual rate 01 one-half per cent. per mensem, or
six per cent. (‘semissium usura’), would have amounted to the same sum,
thirty thousand sestertii per annum.

We have in this ·matter another instance 01 Pliny's clearsightedness‚
parallel to that noticed on Ep. 39. The deterioratiou and even absolute loss
01 charitable and educational lauded endowments in this country is familiar
to all students 01 local history. Pliny’s scheme seems free from all objection,
as it was calculated to insure the safety 01 the endowment without breaking
up his own estate. ‘Vectigales agri' were recogniscd by the Roman law:
the lessees had a right to retain the laud so long as they paid the charges
due, and this right in the land could probably be disposed of by will. At
any rate, in the conclusion 01 the letter Pliny seems to contemplate the land
as remaining in bis disposition, though lowered in value by more than the .
amount 01 the charge on it, from the fact 01 its being ‘vectigalis'

16. Diligentius muneri suo consulere, ‘to be more caresul 101 the
·security 01 one’s gift than the interests 01 one's property? ‘Se’ and ‘suus’
sometimes stand 10 universal assertions (without being referred toa definite
subject preceding) in the signification, 01 ‘one’s self,' ‘one's own,' Madvig,

Adsidet: 101 this special sense, cp. ‘nihil scribere adsidenti vacat’
Ep.14.45.

16. Messio 0010. The share 01 this man in the death 01 Helvidius is
alluded to in a previous letter, where he is rnade to speak 01 Senecio as one
01 his victims, ‘mei mortui' Bk. 1. 5.

17. Commentarios3 the diaries and note-books 01 Helvidius. Caesar
gave this name 01 ‘commentaries' to his works ‘quod nudi essent omni
ornatu orationis’ cic. Brut. 75.

ar. Abolitos senatusconsulto. Cp. ‘Non in ipsos modo auctores
sed 10 libros qnoque eorum saevitum, delegato triumviris ministerio ut monu-
menta clarissimorum ingeniorum in comitio ac 1010 urerentur' Tac. Agr. a.
