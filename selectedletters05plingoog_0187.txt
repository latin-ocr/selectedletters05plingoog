He says further in support of this interpretation of ⁴ sacramentum ' in this
place, ‘The account given in this passage refers to what the whole assembly
were wont to do at the same ς they could not all corne to receive Raptim,
though they might come to receive the Eucharist' lb. Tertullian. con·
trastiug the commauds of the Lord with superadded tradition, employa the
word ‘sacrament' to denote the Lord's Suppes, and also confirma Pliny's
account of its being received before daybrealr. ‘Eucharistiae sacramentum, et
ln ternpore victus, et omnibus mandatum a Domino; etiarn antelucanis

, coetibus uecde aliorum manu quam praesidentium sumimus· Tert. de Cor.

c. 5, p. roa, ed. Rig.

35. Rursusque coeundi: i. e. for the love feast in the waning, now
distinct from the Eucharist, which latter was no longer taken ‘ in tempore
victus’ at meai-time. Tert. l. c. ‘Coeundi’ is inserted from the Aldine
edition.

36.1²r0mrsnuum. ‘ordinary' cp. ‘promiscua et vilia‚’ common and
eheap articles? Tac. Germ. 5. This account of the food at the Agapae was
given by the Christians in refutation of the common charge that they ate
human fiesh3 a charge which arose frons the language which they employed
respectiug the Body and Blood of Christ.

38. Hetaerice. Chrbs or guilds, for whatever purpose, were looked on as
dangerous; cp. Trai. 34 and 93. This being so, the doctrine of the unity of
the Church of Christ. and the practice of ‘ love of the brethreu' would, so
far as they were understood, appear to the gorernrnent more formidabis
than the other features of Christianity. ,

39. Minicium, apparently a translation of tadmor, desconesses, a
· recoguised order in the early eunuch Rom.16.1.

46. Civitates. Here we see ‘ civitas ’ on its way to the exclusive sense
of ⁸ city‚’ which it has reached in modern languages. But iu Cicero we lind
a distinction clearly laid down between ‘ civitates: commonwealths of ‘cives’
and‘urbes'tbe places of their habitation. Pro Sest.4a. ln Gellius we find
note taken of the confusion of the two words, and the use of ‘civitas ’ ¹pro
oppido et pro homiuum multitudine' Geli. 18. 7.

50. Paetum. It does not appear bow the food of victims differed from
that of other cattle, They may perhaps have been graned iu tbe precinctu
of the temple at the expense of the intending sacrificet.

Ep. 91. a. Neque enim in universum. Trajan refuses to write
such a ‘rescript’ as might be taken fora law of the empire (aeeon Ep 86. 4),
aud confines himself to an approval of Pliny's conduct. TraJan seems to
have thought that the new sect would require different treatment according
to the political condition of the places iu which it appeared; for his point of

empne.
