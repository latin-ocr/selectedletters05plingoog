Cuius Pnuuus CAECILIUS Sucuwnus son of Lucius Caeci· ’

lius, was born an. 62 at Comum or Novum-Comum,
on Lake Larius the modern Lago di Co‘mo. His father
dying when he was young, he was adopted by his uncle,
C. Plinius Secundus, whose name he took, and of whose
immense literary industry he gives an interesting account
(Ep. ¹25). He was brought up under the care of Verginius
Rufus, whose character he describes (Ep. 16), and was
instrueted by Quintilian and Nicetes Sacerdos (Ep. 55).
At the age of fourteen he relates that he wrote a Greek
tragedy: so, at least, it was called (Bk. 7. 4). His letters
make frequent mention of the friends of his boyhood and
youth, and give a favourable impression of their pursuits
and character (Epp. 19, 40, and 41). When a boy of
fifteen he was chosen patron hythe inhabitants of Tifer-
num, near which town he had estates in Tuscany. Two
years afterwards he was present with his mother at
Misenum when the eruption of Vesuvius took place, in
which his uncle perished, and of which he gives an
account in two celebrated letters (Epp. 59 and 61). He
was eighteen years of age when he began to speak in
the forum (Bk. 8. 5), and probably within two or three years
from this time went to Syria as military tribune (Epp. 6
and 28). Even during this service he found time for
his studies, and took advantage of intercourse with the
philosophers Euphrates, Musonius, and Artemidorus (Ep. Ι6).
