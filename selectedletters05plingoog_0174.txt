, sp. 69. 1. Historias tuas. The trial of Massa would come within
the scope oi the ‘historiae' ol Tacitus properly so called. lt occurred in
the reign oi Domitian about the time oi Agricola's death, as we leam from
Tac. Agr. sub fin. ‘Massa Baebius iarn tum rcus erat! But inasmuch as
the extem portion of the ‘Histories’ does uot bring us further than the
midst of the reign of Vespasian, we have no means of kuowing whether
Pliny's wish was gratified, though we do know that his presentiment was
disappointed.

3· Ab optimo quoque artifice. The whole letter is an imitation oi
Cicero's letter to Lucceius the historiam urging a similar request, Cic.
Fam. 5.1a. Even the illustration from art occurring here is borrowed from

ι Cicero; cp. ‘Neque enim Alexander ille gratiae causa ab Apelle potissimum
pingi et a Lysippo fingi volebatr sed quod illorum artem curn ipsis tum etiam
sibi gloriae fore putabat? ’

7. Iu publicis actis, the daily gazette published at Rome under the
cuspite, otherwise known as ‘acta diurna‚’ or ‘diurna' These gazettes are ¹
spoken olas being read iu the armies aud the provinces, Tac. Anu. 15. aa.

10. Herennio Senecione. put to death by Domitian on various
charges, one of them that oi having composed the life of Helvidius Priscus,
Ep. 67. 14. Tacitus pays a tribute to his integrity, ‘nos innocenti sauguine
Senecio perfudit’ Tac. Agr. sub fin.

11. Provinciae Baeticae, Audalusia, the southemmost province oi
Spain. lt derived its name from the river Baetis (Guadalquivir) which
traverses it from east to west. It is cut off from inland Spain by the Sierra
Morene, aud open only ou its south-western coast. This fact explains its

Ι connection with Africa under the Empire (cp. ‘Priscus ex Baetica ex Africa

Classicus’ Bk. 3. 9.) and also, later, under the Vandals and the Moors.

The province seems to have been unlucky in its rulers. Twice aiter the

trial of Massa they came to Rome with accusations against Classicus,

and against Gallus. Iu the case of Classicus they prevailed on Pliny to

⁸ appear ior them again, Bk. 3. 4, and the trial is related at length in the

ninth letter oi the same book. ln the case oi Gallus he resolved to
remaiu neutral.

12. Ur bone eius publice custodirentur3 this was to be done iu
order that restitutiou might be made out of them to the provinciale.

16. Ne bona dissipari sinent quorum esse in custodie debent,
‘that they (the consuls) would not allow the property to be made away
with, iu charge of which they ought to be.’ The antecedent of ‘quorum'
is ‘boua,' not ‘consules' nor ‘ab iis’ understood. Either of the latter
antecedeuts makes the position oi ¹ esse' between ‘quorum’ and ‘ in custodia’
extremely harah aud unnatural. li, on the other hand, ‘esse in custodia’
be considered as oue phrase all is smooth. This explanation (so iar as l
am aware, original) is supported by ‘cum in eiusdem anui custodia te atque
L. Murenam fortuna posuisset’ Cic. pro Mur. 31; ‘retinendus est animus
in custodia corporis' Cic. Rep. 6. 153 in which instances the genitivcs
