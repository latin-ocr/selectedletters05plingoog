Ep. 2.-Some editors think that the book which Pliny alludes to in this
letter is a copy ofa speech which he made before the eenrnmviri, the court
in which he pleaded in behalf ol Attia Viriola who claimed to inherit her
father’s property. He mentions this speech in Ep. 62 ‘Dedimus vela
indignationi, dedimus irae, dedimus dolori: et in amplissimi causis, quasi
magno mari, pluribus ventis sumus vecti.¹ His friends, he says, considered
this to hold the chief place among his speeehes, as the De Coroni among
those of Demosthenes. Unfortunately, except the Panegyric on Trajan, we
have no specimen of Pliny's orations.

4. Eodem ζήλῳ, ‘with so strong an emulation,¹ i.e. of Demosthenes.

5. Demosthenen semper tuum, calvum nuper meum; ‘Demoa-
thenes who has always been your model, Calvus whom 1 have lately taken
as mine!

C. Licinius Macer Calvus is mentioned by Cicero (who was twenty-four
years older) as a young orator who would have been eminent ior eloquence if
hehad lived, but he died in his thirty-fifth orthirty·sixth year. Cicerothought
his style exact and polished, but wanting in force, and fitted fora learned
audience, not lor the multitude. Pliny would hardly have joined him with
Demosthenes il he had agreed with this estimate; and Qrintilian speaks of
it as appearing to many too unfavourable, since Calvus could he forcible as

well as elegant; ‘est et sancta et gravis oratio, et castigata, et frequenter ·

6. Dumtexet flustris orationts3 ‘at least in the rhetorical forms ol the
speech! ‘Figurae' are not merely what we call figures ol speech, metaphors,
or omaments‚ hut include also the forms iu which the sentences were cast,
and even their arrangement, answering partly to Aristotle's σχήματα ripe
λέξεαι, Poet. 19. 7, Rhet. 3. 8, 13 or more properly to his λέξω, Rhet.
2. 9. Repetition of words, exclamations, questions, apostrophem examples,
in lact all methods of enforcing the subject and moving the hearer, are
spoken of as ‘figurae' by Quintilian and Cicero. Demosthenes is particularly
powersul in the use of such tumr of expression. Quintil. Inst. Orat. 9. 1.
cic. de Orat. 3. 52 and 53.

7. Aequus, sc. ‘Jupiter’ Virg. Aen. 6. 129.

9. In contentione dicendi, ‘in avehement style of address.’ ‘contentio
sermonis’ is opposed to ‘lenitas' ‘Tu iamdiu multo dicis remissius et lenius
