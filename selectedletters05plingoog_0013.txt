X LIFE OF PLINV.

Retuming to Italy, probably within three or four years
at most, he devoted himself to public offices and the

employments of an advocate; and his letters contain ’

many allusions to the causes in which he was engaged,
and to his speeches, which he seems to have prepared

with great care (Epp. 12 and 69; Bk. 6. 29). He was ,

quaestor to Domitian, and tribune, and during his tenure
of the latter magistracy thought it decorous to abstain

’ from pleading‚ endeavouring to persuade himself that

’ the office was still one of real importance (Ep. 15). He
was also praetor in the same reign, and from inscrip-
tions published by Gruter and quoted in Masson’s Life
of Pliny, seems to have held other offices. The death
of Domitian, who had lately put to death many of the
best and noblest men in Rome, and banished the philo-
sophers, saved Pliny. An information against him signed
by Carus was afterwards found in the tyrant's desk (Ep.
68). He signalized himself under Nerva in prosecuting
the informers who had become powerful in the reigns of
Nero and Domitian, and by whose accusations some of
. his friends had suffered (Epp. 77 and 28). He was a
personal friend of the emperor Trajan, whom he con-
gratulates on his accession, Jan. ao. 98 (Ep. 85), and
pronounced upon him his Panegyric, when consul ab. roo.
During his absence in the Dacian war some appeals had
been made to the emperor, to hear which he summoned
Pliny to Centumcellae or Civita Vecchia, and soon after-
wards sent him into Asia as Propraetor of the province
of Pontus He remained in this office about a year
and a half, during which he managed the affairs of the
province with uprightness and activity, as his letters to
Trajan amply show. On his return he probably spent
the rest of his life in literary pursuits, political duties
and in managing his estates which were of great value 3
