but little is known of his later years, and the date os his
death is uncertain. Although twice or perhaps thrice
married, he left no children.

The character of Pliny, as it appears in his letters,
is that of an amiable‚ accomplished, and upright man,
exact in public and private dutieS, a kind husband, friend
and master, patriotic, benevolent‚ and just. Much tender-
ness ol heart is shown in his letters to his wise (Epp. 54
and 56), and in others to his friends expressing sympathy
with their griels offering help and counsel (as Epp. 49
and 51; Bk. 8. 5) ; many prove his public· spirit, generosity,
and considerate lrindness towards his townsmen, tenants,
and even his slaves (Epp. 26, 70, 73). And not only

Spurinna (Ep. 24), of Titus Aristo (Ep. 14), and of his
own way ol spending his day (Ep. 82), his letters on the
management ol his estates (Epp. 33 and 76), those
relating to his speeches and senatorial duties (Blr. 3. 9 ; Ep.
62), his confession of his harmless vanity in being mistaken
for Tacitus (Ep. 80), his strong desire ior posthumous
fame (Ep. 74), are all, in various wayS, interesting or
amusing. Those written to Trajan, from Bithynia, with the
emperor's rescripts, give a vivid conception of the con-
scientious labour spent hythe master of the world on the
