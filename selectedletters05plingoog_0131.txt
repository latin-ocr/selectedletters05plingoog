NOTES.

‘Si quadringentis sex septem millia desunt
Plebs eris' Hor. Ep. 1. 1. 58.

37. His, sc. posteris.

38. condicionibus, alliance in marriage. Cp. ‘lnter altissimas con-
diciones’ Ep. 6. 28.

Hie quoque ponendus est calculus, ‘this too must be taken into
account2’ literally, ‘this counter must be placed! ‘Parem calculum
ponere,’ ‘to pay an equivalent’ Ep. 45. 1. ‘Omnes quos ego movi, calculos
pone' Bk. a. 19, ‘take into account every argument that l have suggested!

43. onerare, 'to overload.'

Ep. 10. 1. Promittis 3 understand ‘te ventumm esse! The ellipsis is
not unusual. ‘Ad cenam alio promisi foras’ Plaut. Stich. 4. a. 16. ‘Ad
cenam mihi promitte’ Phaedr. 4. 24. 15.

4. Nam hano quoque ..... ferculo, ¹ you will have to reckon in your
account this too (nivem), which melted in the dish'

5. Betcoel. Properly an adJective, but used, like ‘malvaceus’ from
‘malva,' as a diminutive substantive for ‘beta' Perhaps agreeing with
‘pedes’ understood: ‘beet-root.'

6. Bulbi, edible roots (as onions and others); lt is uncertain of what
exact kind.

Audisses comoedos vel lectorem. Such amusements at meals were
common among the Romans, and with Pliny himself. ‘Cenanti mihi,
si cum uxore vel paucis, liber legitur: post cenam comoedus aut lyristes’

up. 11. Erucius, to whom this letter is addressed‚ is probably Sextus
Erucius Clarus, of whom Pliny speaks in the highest terms in Bk. a. 9, The
family of the Clari at this time were eminent not only in rank, but also lor
virtue and talents. The uncle of Sextus was Septicius, to whom Pliny
dedicates his letters (1. 1), ‘the most truthful‚ single-minded, candid,
faithful of nien ς’ and Marcius the father of Sextus was a man of uprightness
and ability; Bk. 2. 9. Sextus himself, for whom Pliny obtained from Trajan
the ‘latus clavus,' giving him admission into the senate, was praefect of the
city and twice consul: he was remarkable for his devotion to ancient
literature. A. Gellius, 6. 63 13. 17, quoted in Smith’s Dict. Biog. This

accomplished family formed part of that circle of literary friends in
which Pliny lived: they seem moreover to have beeu generally men of
high character in public and private.

1. Hunc dioc nostrtam, ‘l mean my friend Pompeius ;’ perhaps inserted
because there were others of the same name. Nothing more ls known of
