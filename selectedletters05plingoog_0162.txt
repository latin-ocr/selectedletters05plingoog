LETTERS OF'O. PLINIUS O. SECUNDUS. 149

passage be thus filled up, ⁸ hoc, utcumque id fiat, tolerabile est.‘ lie admits
that it is endurable, though he does not clearly see how it can be so. For
the use cp. ‘ Excepto quod adhuc utcumque valemns' Ov. Ep. ex Pont. 4. 14. 3.

14. Acerba, ‘untimely’ The sentence is an apology for applying this
epithet to the death, not ofa child but of a grown man.

ιι. Iaeotulo. See note on Ep. ²4· 11.

aa. Habitum, ‘attitude.'

Scrinium not a desk to write upon, but a box: to hold what was '

written.

30. Frustrer in preparing materials for another volume, which he was
prevented from writing.

up. 47. ln a bantering humour he personifies the epigrams in which he
had promised the appearance of Suetonius' book, and speaks of his verses as
having given bail for its appearance, aud being called upon in legal form to
answer their obligation. For Suetonius see on Ep. 12.

a. Appellantur. ‘Hendecasyllabi’ is the nominative to this verb, and
also to ‘cogantun’ since ‘scripta' nrust evidently be supplied as an accus.
after ed exhibendum.

3. Ad exhibendum termulam eoeipere, to undergo legal proceed-
iugs, such as to make them bring the ‘scripta' into court. These ‘formulae'
were drawn to suit every variety of case, and from thern the plaintiff chose
that which suited him, and inserted his own particulars. ‘ formulam intendere’
was said of the plaintiff, ‘formulam accipere’ of the defendant. ‘Exhibere'
is a technical term, meaning ⁴ to bring into court! The use of the gerund
in this passage is remarkable; and, as it stands after ‘ formulam recipere,’ it
must be translated ‘with regard to bringing them servaro: ‘Ad’ with the
gerund is not employed in final clauses for ‘ut' with subj.

6. vicisti, ‘you have surpassed.' ι 1

8. scazontes, or ⁴choliambi,’ ‘limping iambics‚' were so called from
σκάζω, ‘to limp,' and are iambic trimeters with a spondee or trochee in the
place of the final iambus. They were invented by Hipponax of Elis, who
recorded iu this metre his experience of the married state:

Ab' ἡμέραι γυναικός εἶσιν ἥδισται,

'om γαμῇ τις κὼιφέρῃ τεθνηκυῖαν.
Scazons were not exclusively employed for satire, witness Catullus' beautiful
poem on Sirmio. Cat. 29.

10. Uitulum tuum. See trote on ⁸ indicis' Ep. 25. 3.

Ep. 48. 1. Municipium, sc. Comum.

a. Aemiliae viee eurem. ‘Quatuorviri 'viis curandis' had existed
under the republic; but Augustus increascd their number, separated the care
of the roads within the city from that of the roads without it, and finally
gave a lasting dignity to the office by himself undertaking the care of the
‘via Flaminia,' and allotting the other ‘ viae' to men of note.

Under the ‘Curatores' were 'mancipes' who contracted to perform the
repairs which the former thought necessary.
