LETTERS OF 0. PLINIUS 0. SECUNDUS. 173

were ready to die oi mere obstinacy, a passage referred to ahd explained iu
Smith's Dict. Bible, vol. a, p. 857 note, art. ‘Philosophy'

Pliny could only see in the conduct oi the Christians the violation oi the
most evident duty, that of passive obedience on the part oi subjecte towards
a beneficent government.

16. In urbem remittendo: cp. Acts ²5· ra.

17. Ipso naemu . . . . erimina, ‘when, as usually happens, the charge
became more common, simply from the fact of the matter being dealt with!
‘Crimen' is the charge ot' being a Christian, which now presented itself as
an easy means os gratiiying private enmity, even when there was no evidence
to bring in support of it.

ἠ Titne sao vino supplicarent. Christiane who consented to do
this were known in the Church as ‘ thurificari! Cp. Cyprian, Ep. 5²·

Male crearent Christo. It was a similar command which about
fifty years later drew from Polycarp his dying confession,‘l have now served
him eighty-six years, and he has done meno wrong3 how can 1 blaspheme
my King and Saviourl' “

23. Quorum nihil cogi. Verbs which, like ‘cogo,’ take a double
accusative in the active voice may retain one oi those accusatives in the
passive. Thus, since

‘Quid non mortalia pectora cogis
Auri sacra famesi Ἴ Virg. Aen. 3. 56,
is good syntax, then ‘si cogi aliquid consules possunt' Liv. 4. 26, will also
stand as good.

30. Staio die, namely the first day of the weelr. This account oi the
Christian worship corresponds wilh that given by Justin Martyr, not quite
thirty years later, who mentions assemblies lor the purpose ol worship as
being held τῇ τοῦ ἡλίου λεγομένῃ ἡμέρᾳ Apol. 1. 87.

31. Ante lucem, before the labours oi the day began, which in the oase
of slave Christians would occupy Sunday as much as any other day. Thus
this early honr became the established time for worship, and consequently
lor the administration oi the Holy CommunIon. The same honr is still v
regarded as proper sor that purpose, an example oi how the necessities os an
age establish a custom which long survives that age and iis necessities.

Carmen, not necessarily either lengthy or metrical. All that ‘carmen'
implies is ‘a set form oi words!

Quasi <1093 these words are evidently thrown in by Pliny, and must
not be regarded as evidence of the beliei oi the Church at that time in the
Divinity of Christ. Ι

32. sacramento. Waterland, in tracing the history of the various
names of the Lord's Supper, refers to this as the earliest application to it oi
the name ‘sacrament’ ‘As Pliny is here reporting what the Christiane had

- told him, it is reasonable to judge that they made use of the word “ sacrament’'

to him, which they understood in the Christum sense, however Pliny or
Trajan might take it' Waterland on the Eucharist, c. 1.
