life, and, though much older than himself, had shewn the warmest interest
in his success. On two occasions he relates that he had reco‘urse to him sor
advice in important professional matters, esteeming him one of the most
experienced and wisest lawyers of his time. From this letter we leam that
Corellius survived Domitian (who was murdered Sept. 17, ab. 96), and he
afterwards spoke highly ot' Pliny to the emperor· Nerva. On his deathbed
he mentions Pliny to his daughter as one of the friends she could most rely
on, and both she and her aunt Corellia found him ready todo them kind·

1. Ιί iectura dicenda est. The word ¹ iactura' from its application to
everyday losses oi money, property, dcc, had material associatione, which to

Pliny's refinement made it unsuitable to use of the death of such a friend as ,

Corellius.

4. Utoumqnot see on Ep. 46. 7.

12. Tot pignore, sc. filiam, uxorem, &c ln post-Augustae Latin
'pignora' was applied to all near relations, not merely to children, as the
English phrase ‘pledges.' Cp. Paneg. 37.

few last years of his reign. See Merivale, c. 62.

‘Si‘ as here, is often omitted before a supposition. The subjunctiveis used
here becauie the supposition is false or imaginary. See the distinction
between the sense of the indic. and subj. (when ‘si' is omitted), as explained
byMadvig, §442 a, Obs. a.

39. Hispulla, possibly Calpurnia Hispulla, aunt of Pliny's wife Calpurnia
(Ep. 41), in which case there would have been a connection as well as a
close friendship between Pliny and the house of Corellius.

54. Quae audierim nunqnam, ‘such as l have never heard! The ⁴
subjunctive is used thus, in relative propositione, to complete the idea of
a certain quality. llere the adjective ‘nova' partly expresses the idea; ‘quae
audierim¹ is subjoined in order to detine it more precisely. Observe that in
the next sentence the indic. is used (queo audivi), because it is not a
quality or a class, but particular things that are signified. See Madvig,

We may remark that Pliny seems to have considered it praiseworthy in
Corellius to escape continued suffering by suicide. The practice had become
quite common at this time; but it would be a mistake to think that it was
countenanced by the Stoics. Mt. Merivale remarks that ‘we need not pass
too austere a judgment on the sick and aged who thus courted present relief
from suffering, and even made their escape from a painful existence witha
show ol dignity and fortitude. But we must guard ourselves against con·
founding such ordinary mortals with the genuine patriots and sages, who
proved themselves generally superior to this morbid intemperance.' lt was,
