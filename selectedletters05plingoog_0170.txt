only those two instances are mentioned-in which the verdict was ¹favour·
able.

ao. Isdem iudicibus, not of course individually the same, but judges ·
of different divisions ol the same centumviral court. Ι
- ar'. Non...videretur. See Madv. ξ 357. ab: ‘l use the word

chance, but Ι don't mean to say that it looked like chance! Perhaps he
hints at the possibility of bribery.

¹ 40. Ὑπὲρ Κτησιφῶντος, is as much my best as that is Demosthenes'
best.

up. 63. 1. Recte fecisti: see note on Ep. 4²· 11.

Veronensibus nostris, ‘nostris' because Verona was in ‘ltalia
'Transpadana' ‘illa nostra ltalia’ Ep. 9. 13, in which Conium, Pliny’s birth· ⁶
place, was situated.

a. olim emeris, ‘you are now and have long been loved.' This use os
‘olim' where Cicero would use ‘iamdudum' is characteristic ol the Silver
Age. Cp.

‘Sed olim
Prodigio par estin nobilitate senectus’ Juv. 4. 96,
where see Mayor's note.

The classical uses os ‘ olim· are as follows: (1) nipast time—once, formerly;
(a) oi future time-one day, a time will come when3, (3) of repeated
occurrence-now aud then.

9. Africanae, wild herste, especially panthers. A ‘venatio’ was to

have been combined with a gladiatorial exhibition‚ as was done in the .

Roman ‘ludi circenses.’ ‘Venationes’ consisted either of the destruction os
criminals by wild beasts, or os the destructiones the beasts by trained
‘bestiarii’ Cp. ‘aut h'omo imbecillus a valentissima bestia laniatur, aut
praeclara bestia venabulo transverberatur' cic. Fam. 7. 1.

10. Ad praefinitum diem: see note on Ep. 26. 26.

11. Acceptum fieret; passive of ‘acceptum facere? which means to set
down as having been received from a man. The phrase is used of a debt
which hasbeen paid or is regarded as paid as in Bk. a. 4, ‘quicquid mihi
pater tuus debuit acceptum tibi'fieri iubebo.' Hence the passage above¹
means, ‘you have deserved that you should be considered to have iulhlled
your promise.' ‘Acceptum serre' differs in sense from¹ ‘acceptum facere,'
and means to enter as owed on the debit side cl one's account book.
So the man who scratches out an old debt to himself on the credit side of
his book is said ‘acceptum sacere‚’ whereas he might be said ‘acceptum
ferre' when he enters a debt from himself to some one else ou the debit side.

Ἰ Tibi is ‘ dativus commodi.¹

up. 64. a. Proscribi, ‘to be advertised lcr sale! This was done then,
as now, by putting up on the property a' notice (titulus) to that effect. Cp.
‘proscribebatur tamen (domus)' Ep. 68. 28.
Pro meo quincunce ex septingentis millibus, ‘as my five
twelfths out cf (a total cf) seven hundred thousand sesterces! Ι ln estimating
