LETTERS OF C. PLINIUS C. SECUNDUS. 137

49. clamentem quoquot this frequent proverbial expression ‘continues
the metaphor introduced by stimulis, lit. goads.

50. Ἀγαθή δ’ ἔρις, in allusion to Hesiod's distinction between good and
bad strife, competition and contention. Hesiod describes the former thus,

ἤτε καὶ ἀπαλαμόν περ ὅμοια e'ari ἔργον ἐγείρει.
fles. Op. et Di. ao.

lep. 28. a. In maius. This phrase (with ‘in melius,' ‘in peius,' &c.) is
frequent in Pliny and writers of his age. Cp. also Sall. Jug. 73, and tet τὸ
μεῖζον κοσμεῖν, Thuc. Lat. ' ‘

4. Quum essent philosophi sb urbe summoti. In ab. 86 Do-
mitian revived the decrees of Vespasian against the philosophers.

6. uus praetor. fle allowed himself to be promoted by Domitian until
that emperor’s final ontbreak of cruelty iu the slanghter of Senecio, Rusticus,
and the rest. aster this he determined to retire into privacy, yet he was
obliged to fulfil the remaining term of his office as praetor. ‘Provectus ab
illo insidiosissimo principe antequam profiteretur odium bonorum, postquam
professus est substiti' Plin. Pan. 95.

8. Mussant'ibus. By the whispering murmure of persons in· doubt,
‘musso' passes from the sense of murmuring to that of hesitation, which
latter is frequent enough; cp. ‘Mussat rex ipse Latinus Quos generos vocet’
Virg. Aen. 12. 657.

10. septem amiota meis. 'l'his seems a convenient opportunity for
some account of that great and ill-fated family, of whose virtues and sorrows
these letters so often speak. Ep. 3¹ contains nearly as much as is known
of Caecina Paetus and Arria his wife, who perished for his share in the
conspiracy of Scribonianus against the Emperor Claudius an. 42. They
left a daughter, Arria the younger, already married to Paetus Thrasea,
afterwards the noblest of Nero's victims, in the narrative of whose death
the last extant book of the Annals of Tacitus comes abruptly to a close.
Thrasea's widow, Arria the younger, survived to see the disasters of her
family, and the final return of· happier days under Nerva. The next
member of the family is one of whom Pliny writes with more than usual
affection, Ep. 67. Thrasea Paetus left one daughter, Fannia, married
before his death to Helvidius Priscus, who escaped his father-in-law's
fate only by the alternative of banishment, from which he returned with
his wife after tlte accession of Vespasian. Again the same sentence was
pronounced, and a second time Fannia followed her husband into exile, ⁶ bis
· maritum secuta in exsilium est’ Ep. 67. ra. The enemies of Helvidius, and
his own indiscretion, changed the sentence to that of death; and Helvidius,
under Vespasian, met the fate of his father-in-law Thrasea under Nero.
Fannia returned to Rome with Helvidius the younger, her husband’s son
by a previous marriage. This Helvidius was subsequently married to Anteia,
who, like her husband, had to deplore a murdered father, Anteius, Tac. Ann. 16.
14. ¹Fannia's troubles were not ended, for Domitian had yet to reign. She
furnished Senecio with materials for a life of her husband, and with her
