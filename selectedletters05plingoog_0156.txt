12. Tenerem. Cp. ‘Numeros memini si verba tenerem ’ Virg. Ecl. 9. 45.

19. Eoo. Observe that ‘studeo' begins to take arr accus. together with

Arpi his birthplace.

up. 36. 1. Reginus. See note on Ep. ²3· 4.

Eoo uno molo, &c.; ‘the only misfortune that l grudge him, andl
doubt if he thinks ita misfortune.' Lord Onery takes Pliny to taslr for a
want of humanity in disbelieving Regulus' grief. But Pliny is justified by
the use which the father is said to have made of bis sou’s name in his perjuries.
Ep. ²3· 17. .

4. Emancipavit. ‘set him free from the patria potestas! The boy’s
mother had left her property to him on the condition that Regulus should
first do this. lt was worth his doing, because he thus retained his wife's
property in the family. lt might therefore be said that his son had been
sold by him (mancipatum) for this consideration, rather than gratuitously .
enrancipated. ‘Mancipatus’ is coupled with ‘venditus' Cic. Phil. a. 11.

man' (Regulus).

ao. Pervert103 generally opposed to ‘recte’ ‘against right and reason,'
so much against them that the wrongdoing seems the result of wilfulness

English word 'perverse‘

occupying it, as ‘theatra’ Ep. 3²· 34. Cp. English use of ‘pit' and

7. De vitrasius. This is simple narration. But devita pueri, which
follows, is the scornful reflection of the narrator interrupting himself.

8. Exemplum mille. Whether thisbe or be not taken literally, it
marks the great facility with which copies of boolrs could be made; ¹aud
