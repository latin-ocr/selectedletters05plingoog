ab. Heu paenuria colonorum. Since the ‘coloni' were inseparabls
from the soil. their condition affected the value of the estate.

30. Aliquid tamen fenero. lle had some little money out at interest.
and therefore says above, ‘prope totus!

31. Non mous ao mea. Cp. his letter to her, ‘Non mehercule ram
mea sunt quae mea sunt, qnam quae tua’ Bk. t. 4.

up. ta. a. Lex tabellaria. Cicero mentions four such leges, by which
vote by ballot was gradually sanctioned in the various fonctions of the
comitia: namely, the election of magistrates, the iudicia publica, and the
enactment and repeal of iaws. The dates of these laws range between 139
and 107 no. and Cicero pro Sest. 48, in speaking of the ⁴ Lex Cassia,’ confirma
what is here said of the contentions which the question called forth. When
the election of magistrates was transferred by Tiberius to the senate. the ballot
was laid aside till the date of this letter.

6. contionum, open meetings, as opposed to legally constituted as·
semblies.

16. Sub quo militaveram military service was anecessary qualification
of all candidates for office.

court, instead of being taken from a fixed list as the ‘iudices’ were. So
we find Cicero, Verr. a. 3, 59 and 60, complaining oi Verres for not naming
‘reciperatores de conventu! The point of comparison between the senate on
this occasion and 'reciperatores' lies in the words repente apprehensi.

up. ³6. 1. Ducentiens. We have reason to believe that Martial lived
till the close of the year 100 am.

3. melna, ‘bile‘ the emblem of bitterness. Pliny seems to have in his
mind Martial’s own criticism, Mart. 7. 25, which enumerates the same ingre·
dietus, 'sah' ‘fel‚' and ⁴ candor,’ as necessary for epigrama that were meant to
be read.

Candoris, kindness oi heart. Ovid credits Salanus with ‘candor' for
his sympathy with him in his exile, although their acquaintance was but
slight. Ov. Pont. a. 5, 5. Sincerity was not necessarily implied in the
word, and indeed candour,in the English sense, could not possibly have been
attributed to the sycophant Martial.

4. Prosecutus oram. ‘Prosequor' is only twice used in these letters in
the sense ‘to accompany.' but very frequently in its idiomatic tenu, ‘to
compliment with: followed by such ablatives as ‘libello,' ‘legatis' ⁴ suffragio!
lt seems to be used of such attentioris as could not be claimed or even ex·
