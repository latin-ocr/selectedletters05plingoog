4· Rescripta By this time the word ‘rescriptum’ had attained a
technical sense, riu. an answer in writing given by the emperor to rome
magistrate or private person consultiug him, which when given carried tlte
force of law. ht a later period (in the Instituter oi Juetinian) ir was held
that whatever the emperor determined by letter (⁸ rescriptum ')‚ or decided
judicially (⁶ decretnm'), or deelared by edict (‘edictum’), was the law oi the
empire. There three classes of decisione were included under the generel
name ‘constitutionem’ These ‘constitutiones’ were preserved in the imperial
archiyes eren from the time oi Augustus, and copies oi thern more or lese
complete were also to be iound at the seete ol provincial government. A
careful discrimination was observed between those constitutione which were
ol universal end those which were ol special application. Cp. ‘Aut proprium
aut universale' Ep. 87. 4. .

ro. Duobus matrimoniis meis. lt appears to be uncertain whether
Pliny was married once or twice before hir marriage with Calpurnia. We
know from Ep. 77. ur and 65 that the wife who immediately preceded
Calpurnia died shortly after the accession oi Nemand that her step-fether'r
name was Vettius Proculus. Pompeia Celerina, whom Pliny speaks oi as
his ‘socrus' (Bk. 1. 4), was probably the mother oi thie previous eriis, and
therefore had married Vettius Proculus us her second husband. See on
Ep. 41.

We are rhen wholly without trece oi a nutriage on l’liny’s part previous
to that with the daughter oi Pompeia Celerina. Mommsen (Onomasticon,
Keil’s emended), apparently on the strength oi this letter only, thinks that
two marriages must have been contracted ln the reign of Domitian, ln which
cese the ‘socrus' mentioned in Ep. ra.8 must be the mother ofu wife
married when Pliny was still ‘adulescentulun’ who siterwards made wey by
death sor the daughter oi Pompeia Celerina.

But the passage before us does not clearly stete thtt the two marriages
were contracted in Domitian's time, but only trnt the fect of his wishing to
heve children even thenis proved by the incr os his not heving waited till
now to be married, but haring married once before, es wellas once now,
twice in all. We may perhaps suppose that Pliny, like an advocate, gere
the sentence an equivocal turn to make his cese look better than it was.
