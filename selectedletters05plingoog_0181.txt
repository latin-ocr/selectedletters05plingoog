the water. So Thetis bi'ds the dolphins (which are to carry her and Achilles
to Scyros) to draw up ‘pleno in litore,' where the water covers the shore,
‘ne nudae noceant contagia terrae’ Stat. ach. 1. 227.

41. superfudisse unguentum. lt was customary to consecrate and .
ancint iavonrite animals‚ such as elephante, horses, birds, &c See Casaubon
on Suet. Jul. 81.

48. Ad quod coibatur, ‘the object of the concourseff

np. 82. 4. Quae evocent, ‘which distract one’ Cp. ‘Magis mihi vox
avocare videtur quarn crepitus' Sen. Ep. 56. Ἰ

6. Quotiens non vident slis, ‘whenever there is not something else
for them to look at!

7. Ad verbum scribenti, ‘writing out in tull? He means that he
composes mentally with as much care and minuteness as is he were writing
and correcting on paper. So Quintilian, speaking os a habit oi Cicero's which
he is recommending and explaining, says ‘lllud quoque ad verbum ponere
optimum luerit‚' i. e. in all its details; Quint. Inst. Or. 11. a.

9. Notarium. See on Ep. 25. 54.

15. Intentio, something stronger than ‘attention,’ more like ‘concen-
tration.' It was stimularet, not attested, by the change and exercise.

ao. comoedus. See on Ep. 24· 3⁶·

Cum meis, sc. ‘libertis' Cp. ‘Gymnasium meorum’ Ep. ar. 3²·

middle ages was the offspring oi the system cf ‘coloni‘ Itis not difficult to

np. 83. 1. nemetensis. The fundamental application oi’ this word is
to things not original, but copied or horrowed, as were legal formulae or the
praetor’s annual edict. For this sense cp. ‘Hoc vetus edictum translaticiumque
esse' Cic. Verr. a. 1, 443 and Cic. Div. 8. 5, where ‘haec translaticia' means
‘the old stoty.’ Hence it declines into the sense of iormal, unmeaning,
commonplace, as here. Cp. also ‘non translaticia deformitate‚' ‘no common
unsightliness,’ Petrou 110.

4. Nisi. The use of ‘nisi’ for ‘ni’ or ‘si non' in this passage is
certainly awkward. The negative is thereby removed from videre, with
which in sense it is closely united; and the clause nisi te Kalendis, &c to

which the whole sentence leads up, is introduced by a conjunction (⁸ nisi ’) s

which is generally employed to insert an exception. ‘Per “nisi '¹ significatur
exceptio quae ad aliquam sententiam accedit' Hand. Turs. sub. voc. ‘Nisi’

' where the distinction between ‘nisi' and ‘si non' is clearly laid down. ‘Nisi’

is nearly coextensive in its use with the English ‘ unless)

The sense of the passage may be brieily given thus, (1) you are too kind to
insist on this rubbish; (a) l arn too dear a friend to be suspected ot' coldness
iil don't (⁶ nisi ’) corne ; (3) but above all l am very busy about my farms.
