mother Arria suffered a third banishmeut for her share in the matter, while
Senecio expiated his by death, ‘tertio ipsa propter maritum relegata’ Ep. ὀμ 3.
At the same time, Fannia’s stepsou Helvidius the younger was condemned
on a trifliug charge, and this is the Helvidius to whose murder allusion
is made iu this letter. With him suffered a close friend of the family, Arulenus ⁴
Rusticus, on the same charge as Senecio, while the wife of Rusticus, Gratilla,
aud his brother Junius Mauricus were banished. Nerva's accession brought
back the exiles, and the gloomy baud of moumers which advances from
this single' family and its connections enables us to conceive what was that
laceration of the state which Domitian completed, ⁸ nou iam per intervalla
et spiramenta sed continuo et velut uno ictu' Tac. Agr. 44. Four widows,
Arria, Fannia, Anteia, Gratilla, moumed for husbands, three of them for fathers,
who had perished‚ while Junius Mauricus lamented a brother. ln this society
Pliny lived, having himself barely escaped, Ep. 68. 65. His bitterness against
the delatores, Regulus, Bk. 1. 5, Certus, Ep. 77, in part causes of so much
misery, is easy to understand, and is iu no way contrary to his usual humauity.

up. 29. 3. Erunt officis antelucana, ‘early visits of compliment will
be going on.’ ‘Officium' was the common name for the various attentioris
shown by one friend to another, or by a client to his patron, such as the
morning salutation. This took place at daybreak; cp. 'Prima salutantes
atque altera continet hora' Mart. 4. 8. Such ‘officia’ were sometimes
even ‘antelucana ’ς cp. ‘ante lucem ibat ad Vespasianum' Ep. 25. 31.

In quse incidere, ‘to fall in with which,'‚i.e. to meet with the persons
engaged in them. Pliny is afraid that Catilius' party will be so late, that
when he returns home, he will meet with people already beginning the
duties of the next day. It will be seen by the illustration which is given,
that more is meent by ⁴ incidere' thanis actually expressed hy the word.

5. 0. caesar: in his Anticato, a reply to Cicero’s panegyric of Cato.
lt was a considerable work, and is quoted by Geli. 4: 16 asan authority for

Ep. 30. 1. Neo tantum epistula, ‘sed tragoedia! A letter cannot
do justice to it.

he’ or ‘especially iu thar he,’ an imitation ol the Greek idiom ἄλλο). τε ecl.
‘Alioqui,¹ ‘in other respects,’ ‘moreover‚’ is not frequent till the time
of Tacitus and Pliny. Besides its strictly adverbial use with adjectives
and verbs, it is sometimes prefixed to a whole clauses ‘alioqui narrasses
mihi’ Ep. 72. 2, ‘or else you would have told me.'

8. Feruens pavimentum. The floor of the ‘caldarium' iu a Roman
bath, and sometimes the floors of passages (⁶ transitu . . . qui suspensus ’“ Ep.
