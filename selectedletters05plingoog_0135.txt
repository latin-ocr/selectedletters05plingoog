Coelium. M. Caelius Rufus was a younger contemporary of Cicero,
having been born mc. 82, the same year and day as Licinius Calvus. He
wasa man of taient and eloquence, but extravagant and unprincipled. He
was defended by Cicero (pro Caelio) when accused of attempting murder,
and was afterwards one of Cicero’s correspondents (Fam. 8). Seneca calls
him ‘orator iracundissimus' (de lra 3. 8); and the author of the Dial. de
Orat. (ιι) ranks him with Caesar, Calvus, and others, as an orator, although
considering him wanting in grace His speeches have not come down to us.

sumebat, et numerus neque dierum neque patronorum finiebatur' Dial. de
Orat. 38. Pliny complains (Ep. 52) that speeches had become too short, in
his time. Cicero's speech for Cornelius is lost, except fragments.
