154 NOTES.

to those who inquired. There appear to have been two classes of jurisconsulti,
,those who held an imperial privilege of being consulted, ‘ius respondendi,'
and those who did not. The opinions of the former class had of course iar
greater weight in court.

np.59.1.nvunoutt moi. For an account of the lile and studies of
Pliny the elder, see Ep. 25.

3. Inmortalem glorium. He' expresses the same confidence in the
immortality oi the works of Tacitus, Ep. 69. 1. We do not know whether
Tacitus availed himself of the materials here sent him, as the extant portion
of the ⁴ Histories’ breaks off ten years before the eruption.

4. Pulcherrimarum clarissumarum ‘clade' is an ablative belonging
to occiderit, denoting the cause of Pliny's death.

Ut populi, ut urbes, ⁸ as nations and cities did (i. e. perish).' Prob-
ably this refers to Herculaneum and Pompeii, whose inhabitants are with some
affectation styled ‘populi’ Some commentators have understood the passage
as a comparison of Pliny's same with that of such a town as Saguntum.

5. Memorabili casu, abl. after victurus, denoting the cause of his
immortality.

12. Erat Miseni. Suetonius says os Augustus, ‘classem Miseni et alteram
Ravennae ad tutelam superi et inferi maris collocavit' Suet. Aug. 49. This
arrangement seems to have been permanently maintained, and we find
references iu Tacitus both· to the fleet of the Lower sea at Misenum, and
te that oi the Higher or Adriatic sea at Ravenna. The promontory oi
Misenum forms the northern limit os the ‘Sinus Cunianus' or bay of
Naples.

15. Usus ille sole, mox frigida. Cp. ‘Post solem plerumque frigida

Ι lavabatur'Ep. 25. 39.
(instaverat, ‘had taken some luncheon.' ‘Gusto' is used intran-
’ sitively in this sense.

26. Liburnicum, a vessel built in imitation ol those used by the Libur-
nians of Dalmatia. It seems to have had sharp bows and consequent swift·
uess. Juvenal mentions slaves from the same district. Orelli understands
by ‘saevis Liburnis’ Hor. earm. 1. 37, 30, the vessels and not the slaves.
Whatever the Liburnica was, it is at any rate here contrasted with the larger
quadriremes, which are launched when the voyage is changed (vertit ille
eonsilium) from purposes os curiosity to those of succour.

29. Rectinae Tasci: cp. ⁴ Verania Pisonis’ Ep. 23. 3.

30. subintrabat, sc. ‘monti’

43. Stabiis, Castellamare, a village on the side of the bay opposite
Misenum, and looking north-west.

Erat, sc. Pomponianus.

44. Diremptus sinu medio, ‘separated’ srom‘ Pliny by the bay which
lay between them.

47. Certus huss, ‘determined on night! The poets and the later prose
writers use the genitive even aiter adJectives not strictly transitive in sense,
