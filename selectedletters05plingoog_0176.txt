campaign was undertaken to avenge the defeat of Fuscus (Jnv. 4. 111).
and the humiliation of Domitian, vrho is said to have consented to the
payment oi a tribute to Decibalus the Dacian king. In the first campaign
Trajan penetrated to the beart oi Dacia, established a garrison there, and
obtained the complete submission of Decibalus. On his return he celebrated
a triumph, and received the name of Dacicus.

lt was not long before the Dacians, by violating the treaty, provokeda
second invasion, which ended in the defeat and death oi Decibalus, and
the settlement oi Dacia as a Roman province. For a full account of the
Dacian war, see Merivale, Hist. Emp. c. 63.

4. Inmiase terris nova numina. Decibalns temporarily diverted a
river from its course, that he might conceal hls treasnre in irs bed. Trajan

5. Montium abrupta. These were the great difficulties of a campaign
in that region.

· Pulsum regia, namely from Zermizegethusa, captured in the first
campaign.

6. Pulsum saram vita. Decibalus fell by his own hand at the cap-
ture of his hill fort. This completas a noticeable parallel between the
Dacian campaign and the late Abyssiniau expedition, both being triumphs
oi engineering skill and of discipline rather than oi valonr, though
the resistance oi the Dacian was of course more formidable than that of
Theodore. The story ot' the captive Longinus affords another point ol
similarity.

expresses the stubborn unfitness ot‘ Dacian names for Greek metten, with
which, as it were, they rebound from the'm. The labor lies in obviating
this difficulty, tut non resultent!

of the Tiber. The excellence oi the cattle fed on its banks made them
