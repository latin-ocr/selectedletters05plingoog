128 noras.

47. Plausus, in the proper sense, ‘clapping of the hands! The applause
of which Pliny has been complaining was given by cheers and shouts.

Ep. 21. We leam from Bk. 9. 40 that Pliny generally spent the winter in his
Laurentiue, and the summer in his Tuscan villa. In the winter it was desirable
to be near Rome on account of ‘necessitas agendi, quae frequens hieme!

3. Litoris spetlum, the extent of shore belonging to the estate.
‘Litus’ sometimes stands for the seaside estate itself; ‘de electione litorum’
Tac. Ann. 3. 63.

5. Salvo iam et composito die, ‘while the dayis still in your possession
and in its vigour! Cp. ‘virum aetate composita' Tac. hun. 13. r. The only
difficulty in assigning to ‘compositus’ the sense here given, is that the word
naturally contrasts itself with youth and dawn, not, as in this passage, with
age and decline. But when ‘ compositus· has once been established in its
sense of ‘mature’ ‘vigorous' it is plain that it may be equally well contrasted
with either extreme, morning or evening‚ of life or of the day. The context
clearly forbids a comparison with Virg. Aen. r. 374.

8. Utrimque, whether you come by the ‘Via Laurentiua’ or the ‘Via
Ostiensis!

9. Iunotis, ‘for harnessed horses,’ contrasted with ‘equo' From this
contrast we infer the meaning ‘et iunctos etsolutos' Ep. 36. 8, ‘both harneas
and saddle uage?

14. Non sumptuose tutele, ‘and does not eost much to keep up?
Observe the descriptive abl, for which see Madvig, ξ ²7² and ξ 287,
Obs. 2. The gen. might have been used, as the words here do not describe
the constitution of the villa with reference to its external parts! For
‘tutela' in this sense cp. ‘ut villarum tutela non sit oneri’ Prin. N. H.
18. 5.

16. Porticus, plur. two porticoes, placed thus (Ι D, the area being the space
of ground between them. The likeness of the letter D means simply a
semicircle.

18. specularibus, windows of ‘lapis specularis,' mica, which was split
into thiu plates for the purpose.

19. Contra medias. The entrance to the ‘cavaedium' was opposite the
middle of the two semicircular porficoes, so that in approaching it from the
‘atrium'you passed through the convex side of the first portico exactly iu the
middle, then crossed the area between the two, and found the entrance of the
‘cavaedium’ opposite to you in the middle of the coucave side of the further
portico¹

24. A tergo. If the visitor turned quite round after entering the diniug·
room, a beautiful vista was presented to him. The eye passed through the
⁸ cavaedium' and one portico, then across the area, through another portico,
and an ‘atrium' and finally tested on the noodr and hilis which rtrctched
inland.

26. A laeva. on the left of the dining-room as you entem i. e. on its south
