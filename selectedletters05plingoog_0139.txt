4. Beneficiorumtarga 01010110. The commender 01 an army bad in
his patronage the appointment of military tribunes, six to each legion. That
these appointments were canvassed for appears from a similar 10011011 10
favour of Calvisius, Bk. 4. 4.

5. Longum praeterea tempus, during which many tribuneships would
fall vacant, as they were only held for six months; cp. ‘semestri tribunatu,'

8. Voconius. Pliny's anxiety for the interests of Voconius led him
afterwards to solicit for him from Trajan a seat in the Senate. Trai. 4.

Musas ipsus 1111100 1001111 10 adaptation of the eulogy of Plautus

· ar. Trium liberorum ius. The Leges Julia, 11. c. 18, and Papia Pop-
paea, 110. 9, encouraged marriage and the nurture of children to supply the
ravages of the civil wars. They were wide and various in their provisions,
and we may probably attribute to them most of the disabllities which we
find imposed upon ‘caelibes' and ‘orbi’ Lipsius, 10 1 learned excursus on

magistratu ;’ i.e. seniority between magistrates of 001111 rank was determined
by this test. (4) ‘Ut in honoribus petendis gratia sit annorum iis qui

tribunate of the people, was qualified by the possession of children. (5) 'Ut
qui plures liberos habet a cura tutela ceterisque muneribus immunis sit!
All the above privileges aud immunities were summed up in the expression
‘ius trium liberorum) The senate, and afterwards the emperors, granted this
right to distinguished persons. We find that Pliny obtained it for himself
Ep. 86, and for Suetonius, Trai. 95. The reply of TraJan in the latter case
illustrates the words 01100 01 oum delectu in this letter.
