Reirechim pauno: it did not project so far seawards as the dinIng-
room, hence the angulus mentioned below.

Suspensus et tubulatus: see on Ep. 30. 8. The ‘tubi' were
earthenware pipes for conveying hot air.

‘41. Plerisque tem mundiu supply ‘cellis’ or ‘cubiculis’ 'Ihe sub-
stantive is omitted, as the context leaves no doubt of the sense. There may
be truth in Buchner’s explanation that these rooms, although not large
enough ior ‘cubicula,¹ were yet too good to be called ‘cellae ς’ hence the
omission. Here again is a descriptive abl. connected with the words ‘reliqua
pars! -
49. Bemmaris, baths large enough for immersion, but notior swimming.
For the latter purpose the sea was close at hand, and therefore the ⁴ pisciua’
ot' cold water usually placed in the ‘cella frigidaria' was unnecessary.

Propnigeon. a passage leading from the ‘cella frigidaria ⁸ to the

such as an ‘unctorium’ and a ‘propnigeon’ lt is not clear whether the
‘tepidarium' contained a tepid bath, or whether it was merclya warrn room
to sit in.

54. sphaeristerium: see Ep. 24. 29· As the exercise of ball
play immediately preceded the bath, this was the natural place l'or the
⁴ sphaeristerium!

59. Apotheoe3 here was kept the wine in ‘amphorae’ (in hottle).
The ⁶ apotheca ' was generally, as here. on the first-floor, and near the batha,
that the wine might benefit by the smoke of the fornace. ‘Dolia' (wine in

‘ cask) were kept in the ‘cella vinaria’ on the ground-licor. See Becker’s

Gallus, Sc. 9, Exc. 4.

62. Gestatio, an avenne or drive running round the garden.

69. Eae . . . facie. ‘this view‚' i. e. of the gardcn.
