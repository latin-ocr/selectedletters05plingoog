or render thus: ‘my affection for him was not merely commensurate with
my admiration for his public conduct.'

32. Ad omnosuonorsseeoueunrt. Erery candidate forofficeexpeeted
his friends, as a matter of course, to attend him at the election. This
attendame was chief among the ‘officia’ or duties of compliment which
friendship enjoined, such as ‘officium togae virilis‚’ ‘nuptiarum' and the
rest. While the electione were held in the Campus Martius the duty
of these attendant friends consisted of three parts: first, they forwarded the
candidate's election by recommending him as ‘testes' or ‘suffragatores 3'
secondly, they voted for him themselves; thirdly, they accompanied him to
the Capitol, where some form of inauguration was observed. The third
book of Varro, De Re Rust. is represented es a conversation among the
friends of a candidate for the aedileship, who are waiting close by for the
result of the election. After the transfereuce of the electione to the Senate,
the cnstom of complimentary attendance on candidates still survived, and at
length the ‘suffragatores' became so clamorous as to compel resnrt to the
ballot. Ep. 34.

36. Quinqusviros. commissione were appointed under this name for
various purposes in the time of the republic and the empire. The number
five seems to have been adhered to because found convenient in case of a

satire.

a. Familiares. This word has not here a general reference, but describes
Pliny's relations with this particular acquaintance.

5. Minuta, serape, such as ‘semesus lepus,' ‘minor altilis? Juv. 5. 107.

19. In ordinem redigenda est. The phrase is transferred from the
constitution of the state to that of the human soul. Appetite must be
stripped of its authority, must obey instead of commanding. Cp. ‘in .
ordinem cogi’ Ep. r5. 4.

up. te. r. Hominem repatriantem accus. of exclamation, Madvig,
5236.

3. Invidebis3 constructed by Pliny witha dat. of the person, and an abl.
of the thing. So‘invideoaliisbono‘Ep.6.43. The abl. marks that in re·
spect of which the envy is felt, and sometimes hasa preposition prefixed, as
‘nisi in hoc Crasso inviderem’ Cic. de Or. a. 56. lt is evident that an accus.
of limitation would answer the same purpose, hence we find ‘invidit
collibus umbras’ Virg. Eci. 7. 58. Also the dat. of the person may be
erchanged for the accus. which appears in fact to have been the more ancient =
