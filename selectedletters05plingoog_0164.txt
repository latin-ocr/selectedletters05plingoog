LETTERS OF Ο. PLINIUS 0. SECUNDUS. 151

‘utilitates’ gains. For the mle concerning' plureis of substantives of abstract
meaning, see Madvig, ξ 50, Obs. 3.

16. Sine fructu posteritatis, without producing their legitimare fruit
of lasting fame, see on Ep. 16. 5.

17. Abierunt. The ⁸ editio princeps' substitutes ‘aruerunt' which would
suit the metaphor suggested by various parts of the passage; such as, in flore
primm maturuissent; sine fructur.

Frenos. In the case of those substantives which have more than one
plural form, the neuter form is usually confined to poetical use; cp. ‘ostreae
ostrea‚' and ‘sibili‚ sihila.’

Ep. 52. 1. Quaerere: cp. ‘quaerit patria Caesarem’ Hor. Canus.
5,15.

M. Regulum: see on Ep. ²3· 4.

3. Quemvis non posset ediscere. Regulus wrote and prepared hir
speeches with great care, but never could quite get them by beart, which
spoiled their effect. ⁸

lt will be worth while to examine the history of this passage as an instance
of the way in which the text was corrupted for want of a close adherence to
MSS. The Medicean MS. read, for ‘posset ediscere‚’ ‘posse te discere.’
Catenaeus, an early editor, saw this would not do, and cutting ‘te' in two,
restored ‘t’ to the previous ⁶ posse) arrd ‘e' to the following ⁸ discere? But not
content with this he introduced ⁸ d,’ and printed ‘quamvis non posset dedis-

cere! He then removed the full stop, and took illud ipsum and the following
sentence as the accusative of ⁸ dediscere,’ introducing hopeless confusion, and
compelling the readcr to take veniebat as sn impersonal verb. This con-
fusion was perpetuated by Cottius, and all the inferior modem editions, e. g.
the Tauchnitz edition.

5. Uiroumlinebut; with paint.

ιο. Una dicentibus, ‘ to the counsel engaged in the same case3' not,
‘on the same side!

Libera tempore. Cn. Pompeius, by a law passed in his third consul-
ship, defined the proportione of time to be allotted to the accuser and the
accused respectively. The enactment was primarily to regulare the trial of
Milo then about to take place, Ascon. Arg. Cic. pro Mil. The proportion
was apparently that of two to three, and was measured by ‘clepsydrae' But
if the plaintiff or prosecutor asked for ⁸ libera tempora: unlimited time, then
the same privilege was necessarily granted to the other side.

11. Auditum corrogasset. For Pliny's opinion on the custom of
inriting or hiring an audience, cp. Ep. so. 15. ¹

ra. Sub ulterius invidie. Regulus bore all the odium attaching toa .
protracted trial and a paclred audience, Pliny reaped the advantages of
unrestricted time for his oratory anda crowd of listeners‚ in the midst of
which he found himself ‘caught‚’ as he expresses it. lie had not brought
them, but there they were. The remembrance of all this is what leads him
to look for Regulus, ‘quaerere Regulum,' with a sort of half regret.
