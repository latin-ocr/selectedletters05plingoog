LETTERS OF C. PLINIUS 0. SECUNDUS. 141

up. 88. 1. Adeumo ‘se in eonsilium: a technical phrase, used
especially of the imperial ‘consiliarii' See on Ep. 42. 1.

3. Sollicitent; here as elsewhere=·alliciunt,' which seems to point to a
community of derivation for the two words, either real or supposed.

4. Iunganol. cp. ‘Si Libyam remotis Gadibus iungas' Hor. Od. a. a,
10.
6. Procuratore. One steward would be quite sufficient, and fewer
'sub·agents’ or ‘clerks‘ ‘actores' would be required for contiguous estates,
than for such as lay entirely separate from each other. There is no mention
ofa ‘villicus' or farm-bailiff, as this estate seems not to have been fanned ’
by the owner, but let out to ‘coloni’

7. Unam villam colere. lt would be sufficient to have a house of
tesidence, ‘villa urbana,' on one of the two estates. The other might
simply be kept up as a ‘villa rustica' for the habitation of agents and slaves.

9. Atpiensium the ‘atriensis’ and the slaves under him had to keep in
order the house and furniture. .

eopiosior-um, fancy gardeners. whose art consisted in training and
clipping into shapes and pattcrns (‘ litteras quae nomen domini dieunt ;'
‘bestiarum effigies' Bk. 5. 6) those evergreen plante which then formed the
chief ornaments of Italian gardens. Cp. ‘topiarium laudavi: ita omnia
convestit hedera qua basim villae, quae intercolumnia ambulationis ut,’ &e
Cic. ad Q F. 3. 1. See Recker’s Gallus, Exe. a, Sc. 5.

17. Materiam, timber for building, not wood for fuel; in which sense
always ‘lignum’ from ‘lego‘ or ⁴ ligo?
= ao. Pignora, the farm stoek, live or dead, on which distraiut was
made. This would include the slaves belonging to the ‘coloni'

Reliqua, arrears.

23. Instruendi 3 ‘they therefore (the ‘coloni,') must be provided with
slaves at so much higher a price than usual, because good slavea' The
‘coloni' though attached to the land, and themselves to some extent under
servile disabilities, were nevertheless tenants paying rent and possessing
property of their own in stock and slaves. See Smith’s Dict. Ant. art.
‘Colonus‚' and Daubeny’s Roman Husbandry, Lect. 2.

Quod frugi. Pliny has no‘servi vincti* to give them. This class
of slaves being uutrustworthy worked in fetters and were confined in a sort
of prison. He must therefore buy ‘servi soluti' of good character, and
these will cost a great deal, and add greatly to the expense of entering upon
the property.

25. Sestertio tricies. Α milllon of sesterces is regularly expressed by
‘decies centena millia sestertium’ (Abbreviated gen. plur. for ‘sestertiorum.')
But instead of this we commonly find the abbreviated expression, ‘decies ses·
tertium’ (generally reversed, ⁸ sestertium decies'), and so on for larger numbers.
ln such expressions ‘sestertium’ which is properly a gen. plur, is treated as
a neuter subst. sing. Madvig, Suppl. a. From this imaginary subst. we here
have 'sestertio,' abl. of price.
