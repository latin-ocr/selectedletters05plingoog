the worlrs of Saturninus than may be gathered from this letter, but there are
epistles addressed to him. Bk. 5. 213 7. 7 and 153 9. 38.

5, Sive meditata sive subite proferret, ‘whether he spolie from
preparation or extempore.’

6. Aptae crebraeque sententiae. ‘Sententia' had a technical meaning
in writers upon style, and is defined by the author of the treatise ‘ad
Herenniurn’ (c. a) as ‘Oratio sumpta de vita, qnae ant quid rit, aut quid
esse oporteat in vita, breviter ostendit,’ hence the phrase ‘maxima senten·
tiarum,’ ‘a maxim.' Qrintilian classes ‘sententiae' among the ‘lumina’ of
a speech, and from his examples it appears that he means not only general
maxims, but other pointed rayings, briefly expressed. The orators of this
age, he says, were too fond of filling their speeches with these ‘sayings,'
which should be more sparingly used. ‘Ego vero haec lumina orationis
velut oculos quosdam esse eloquentiae credo, Sed neque oculos esse toto
corpore velim. ne caetera membra officium suum perdant: et, si necessest,
veterem illum horrorem dicendi malim, quan istam novam licentiam. Sed
patet media quaedam via’ Qrint. 8. 5.

7. Antiqua: opposed to modern or newly coined words. The older
words were considered more expressive (propria) than modern ones; as the
use of words of Saron origin in English instead of those of Latin origin is
thought a mark of vigour.

9. Si retraotenbur, ‘if they should be afterwards read ;’ literally,
‘handled again! The orations of Pompeius were pleasant both to hear and
read.

13. contionibus, speeches related (or invented) in his history; enesioni-
bus‚ those which he himself delivered in pleading.

14. Pressior . . . . seductior, ‘more brief, compressed, and concise!

16. Catullus eut curus. For Calvus as an orator, see note on Ep. a. 5.
Nothing but a few small fragments of his poems remain: but in spite of
Horare's sneer,

·Nil praeter Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum'
Sat. 1. ro. 19.
they were highly esteemed by the ancients for grace and wit.

Catullus was a contemporary of Calvus, having been bom at Verona, five
years before him, nc. 87.

18. Data opere, ‘on purpose.⁹

ar. Metro solutum ; i.e. they had the elegance of Plautus or Terence,
without the metre.

aa. Qui ille aut componet, ‘because he either composes them or‚' dcc.
The subjunctive in the relative proposition expresses the reason.

25. Antequam scribam. The subjunctive is found with ‘antequam' in
speaking of a thing which usually happens before something else. ‘Qui
quotidie antequam pronuntient, vocem excitant’ Cic. de Or. 1. 59. So
‘antequam scirem’ may be explained in the second line of this letter.
