quarn illa summa vis et contentio probatur' Cic. de Or. 1. 60. ‘Con-
Ι tentiosa oratio: Bk. a. Iq, is different, and means a contentious speech.

12. ληκύθους, lit. flasks for oil or artists' ,colours Hence λήκυθοι and
the Latin equivalent ‘ampullae' were used for rhetorical. ornaments and
exaggerations which writers and speakers employed to deck their language.
Cp. Cic. Att. 1. 14. and Hor. Ep. 6. 3, 14. Pliny calls these ornaments

Marci nostri ληκύθους because Cicero in the passage quoted had confessed
to their use.

14. Necestquod putes. Arrianus is not however to think that,because
he makes this stipulation in favour of omament‚ he therefore wants ‘venia’
instead of ‘ emendatio! ¹

15. Quo magis intendam limem tuam, ‘that Ι may urge you to more
searching criticism ;’ lit. ‘that I may give more force to your iile.’ ‘Lima’
is a common metaphcr for care in polishing verse or prose. Martial
(speaking of Pliny’s criticism on his book) says,

‘Qtem censoria curn meo Severo
Docti lima momorderit Secundi’ Mart. 5. 80.

η. Fortasse errori nostro. ‘what is perhaps my totty: nameiy his in·

His damnare reos. illis absolvere culpae'
Ov. Met. ¹5· 41.

3. Euripus. This name, specially applied to the strait between Euboea
and Boeotia, was used both in Greek and Latin oi any narrow canal or conduit,

‘Ductus vero aquarum, quos isti nilos et euripos vocant' Cic. Leg. a. 1.

4. serviens lacus. ‘Serviens’ carries out the metaphor of subiectus.
Here it means ‘yielding itself to the view‚' and so serving to enhance the
attractions of the villa. Cp. ‘Piscinam quae fenestris serviret subiacet' Bk
5. 6, and ‘Diversis servit sua terra fenestris’ Stat. Silv. a. a, 75.

5. Gestatio. This was an avenue l'or exercise on horseback‚ in a
carriage, or in a litter. It was sometimes covered. Cp.

‘Porticus in qua
Gestetur dominus quoties pluit’ Jur.7.178.

6. wrtoltnis ills populeris, ills peucom, ‘those dining-rooms sor
large parties, and the others for small ones.’ ‘Triclinium’ was extended to
mean the soom for dining in, as well as the couch t'or dining on. ‘Popularia'
