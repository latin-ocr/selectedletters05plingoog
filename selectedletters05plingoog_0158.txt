LETTERS ΟΡ 0. PLINIUS C. SECUNDUS. ' 145

50. Quem fiduciam. This, like the close of Ep. 37, is one of those
epigrammatic surprises which stamp Pliny’s prose as well as Martial’s verse
with the character of ‘flavian polish and retirement!

In conclusion it will be worth while to put together what can be gathered
from this letter respecting education in the provinces.

Schools of two separate kinds were in existence, firstly‚ govemment
schools, not uncommon (⁸ multis in locis’); and secondly, schools established
by public subscription where sufficient money could be raised to engage a
teacher. We do not hear of teachers starting schools on a private venture.
They expected to be engaged (¹ conduci') with a certain payment guaranteed.
If there was a good school in any place, boys came from a distance and
took lodgings in the place to attend it.

Pliny‘s views set forth in this let'ter attest not only his generosity and
interest in education, but a shrewd judgment in the matter quite on a level
with modern opinion. He sees the danger of bad appointments likely to
arise frorn fixed payments and centralization, and he also sees the necessity
of some subsidy to encourage local effort.

We must add to the list of his benefits to Comum the establishment ofa
public library, and an endowment for the support of a certain number of
free-born children. Bk. 1. 8.

np. 40. 5. corelli filiam3 perhaps the first cousin of Pliny's second
wife Calpurnia. See note on the following letter. For Corellius see note on
Ep. 7.

15. Contra, ‘just the other way)

16. Ponitur inspexi. Pliny uses the same phrase with reference to
Euphrates, Ep. 6. 4; and of Trajan, Pan. 83.

17. Nihil s ms; supply ‘habuit’

21. Suffragator- οὓ testis. Cp. ‘Testes et laudatores dabat, vel eum
snb quo militaverat, vel eum cui quaestor fuerat, vel utrumque si poterat.
Addebat quosdam e suffragatoribus: illi graviter et paucis loquebantur' Ep.
34. 15. Though this description refers to an earlier state of things, yet no
doubt something of the same order was observed in the time of Pliny.

In inchoandis deductor. See note on Ep. 16. 3².

26. De bonis iuvenibus. Pliny was, at the time mentioned, thirty-live
years of age, and therefore in the period of ‘iuventus’ which succeeded
‘adolescentia’ and was-reckoned to begin at about the age of thirty.

36. Cornutum. Ep. 48 tells us all we know of Cornutus.

41. Nove lis. ‘Nova' is limited by ut.

Fosminee. The action, whatever it was, was of a kind not usually
brought againstawoman. ·

np. 41. This letter is addressed to Calpurnia Hispulla, daughter of
Calpurnius Fabatus, and aunt of Calpurnia, Pliny’s second (or third) wife,
whom Hispulla had brought up. The fact of her having been brought up by
her aunt makes it probable that her mother, as well as her father, must have
died when she was a child; and hence we may conclude with Mommsen
